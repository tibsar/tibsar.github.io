    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems like the hardest part of learning a language is knowing its tricks.  In Ruby, one of these tricks is turning an array into a hash.  So let's get started!</p>

<p>Suppose you have the following array:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby ">elegance_level = ["wedding", 10, "yacht", 10, "shack", 0, "wine", 8, "beer", 3, "cologne", 6]
</code></pre>

<p>This array seems to be assigning a level of elegance to the item before it, so a hash may be better suited for it.  You could iterate through the array and assign the values into a hash, however Ruby provides an easier way to accomplish this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby ">Hash[*elegance_level]
 =&gt; {"wedding"=&gt;10, "yacht"=&gt;10, "shack"=&gt;0, "wine"=&gt;8, "beer"=&gt;3, "cologne"=&gt;6} 
</code></pre>

<p>That's it! Hope you enjoyed this short but sweet refactor tip!</p>

    <updated>2015-07-13T17:15:36-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://tibsar.github.io/blog/how-coding-bootcamps-are-like-greek-life</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Coding bootcamps are popping up <a href="http://www.skilledup.com/articles/the-ultimate-guide-to-coding-bootcamps-the-exhaustive-list" target=_blank>across the world</a>.  As a student at a NYC bootcamp, the <a href="http://flatironschool.com/" target=_blank>Flatiron School</a>, as well as a sorority sister of <a href="https://www.dphie.org/Home" target=_blank>Delta Phi Epsilon</a>, I couldn't help but notice some similarities between the two.</p>

<h3>New Member Class</h3>

<p>Even if you don't know much about Greek Life, "pledge classes" are notorious. Now commonly referred to as a "new member class", this is a group of people working towards full membership of the sorority or fraternity. New member classes are encouraged to do everything with each other while they bond over the shared difficulty of balancing the time commitment, classes, and other life responsibilities.  I finished pledging by the spring semester of my freshman year, however I find myself repeating the experience in many ways at the Flatiron School.  Instead of a pledge class of college girls, I'm working with a cohort of men and women in all walks of life.  We all are working towards the common goal of graduation from the program as well as jobs in software development.  During this experience, we all have to balance the intense workload as well as commutes and real world responsibilities. In many ways, my cohort is my pledge class.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://scontent-lga1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/1381481_732106783472536_1494142350_n.jpg?oh=130e32e1004e0c888cc99a607e733584&amp;oe=5625FD31" width="400" height="215"></p>

<h3>Mentorship</h3>

<p>One of the most exciting parts of pledging is getting a big.  This generally happens around halfway through the pledging process.  A big is expected to be a mentor to their little and support them through pledging and beyond. At the Flatiron School, we call this "mentorship".  In week 6, which is halfway through the bootcamp, we receive our mentors.  We can then contact our mentor via email and ask them questions about their experiences.  If they are local and available, we have the option of meeting with them in person as well. While this mentor is not as much of a physical presence as a big, their role is the same.  They share their experiences as someone that has previously experienced the long journey of becoming a developer and can be there to support their mentee through their journey.

<h3>Getting Your Letters</h3>

<p>As a pledge class, we looked forward to the day that we would become full members and finally be able to wear letters.  It was a common part of conversation, as we would plan out what letters we would get and what fabric we would use to make them.  At the Flatiron School, my cohort is excited for the day we get our own Flatiron School hoodies (especially when the air conditioning is a tad too cold).  As a pledge, seeing the sisters wearing their letters was seen as something to work towards.  As a budding developer, seeing the TAs, faculty, and alumni wearing Flatiron gear is a push to keep working hard and a reminder that graduation isn't all that far off.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://themonogramexpress.com/images/thumbnails/rts233.jpg" width="400" height="215"></p>

<h3>Crossover</h3>

<p>As a new member, crossover is the ritual of rituals, the night that everyone has been waiting for, yet came as a surprise. When I was pledging, the date of crossover was kept a secret, so while we looked forward to it, we never knew quite when it would be.  However, when it came it was extremely exciting.  We were finally being accepted as full members of the organization that we had grown to adore.  At the Flatiron School, graduation holds a similar excitement.  While we know when we will be graduating, we can't help but get excited for crossing over from a Flatiron student to a Flatiron alumna.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Sorority life and bootcamp life aren't all that different.  Both involve a community of people looking out for each other. Both have new members that go through a journey towards a common goal.  Both encourage their members to be their best version of themselves. Personally, I think that's pretty neat.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Markdown Cheat Sheet]]></title>
    <link href="http://tibsar.github.io/blog/markdown-cheat-sheet/"/>
    <updated>2015-06-29T16:16:42-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://tibsar.github.io/blog/markdown-cheat-sheet</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Markdown is used <em>a lot</em>, so I figured a cheat sheet could be useful, so here goes:</p>

<h3><a href="#headings">Headings</a></h3>

<h3><a href="#paragraphs">Paragraphs</a></h3>

<h3><a href="#horizontal-rule">Horizontal Rule</a></h3>

<h3><a href="#text-styling">Text Styling</a></h3>

<h3><a href="#links">Links</a></h3>

<h3><a href="#named-anchors">Named Anchors</a></h3>

<h3><a href="#images">Images</a></h3>

<h3><a href="#lists">Lists</a></h3>

<h3><a href="#quotes">Quotes</a></h3>

<h3><a href="#tables">Tables</a></h3>

<p><a id="headings"></a></p>

<h2>Headings</h2>

<p>Headings in Markdown are preceded by the octothorpe (<code>#</code>).  You can also add trailing octothorpes, but this is optional.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">#This is heading 1!
##This is heading 2!##
###This is heading 3!
####This is heading 4!
#####This is heading 5!
######This is heading 6!######
</code></pre>

<p>Another way to create heading 1 and heading 2 are with equal signs (<code>=</code>) or dashes (<code>-</code>) under the text you want in the header.</p>

<pre><code class="mxml ">I'm header 1
============

I'm header 2 
------------
</code></pre>

<p><a id="paragraphs"></a></p>

<h2>Paragraphs</h2>

<p>Paragraphs are determined based off a new line or at least two spaces at the end of a line.</p>

<pre><code class="mxml ">This is the first paragraph, since there is no line separating it from the next sentences.  I'm still in paragraph one.
I'm also in paragraph 1, since there's no blank line. 

I'm in paragraph 2!
</code></pre>

<p><a id="horizontal-rule"> </a></p>

<h2>Horizontal Rule</h2>

<p>You can break up paragraphs with a horizontal line.</p>

<hr />

<p>Just do any of the following:</p>

<p><code>___</code> Three underscores</p>

<p><code>---</code> Three dashes</p>

<p><code>***</code> Three asterisks</p>

<p><a id="text-styling"></a></p>

<h2>Text Styling</h2>

<p>For text styling, the asterisk (<code>*</code>) or underscore(<code>_</code>) is used.</p>

<h3>Bold</h3>

<p>To make an item <strong>bold</strong>, use two asterisks on each side of the item.
<code>mxml
**I'm bold. :D**
__So am I!__
I'm not. :(
</code></p>

<h3>Italic</h3>

<p>To make an item <em>italic</em>, use one asterisk on either side of the item.
<code>mxml
*I'm italic. :D*
_So am I!_
I'm not. :(
</code></p>

<h3>Strikethrough</h3>

<p>To <del>strikethrough</del> an item, use two tildes (<code>~</code>) on either side of the item.
<code>mxml
~~I've been struck!~~
I have not.
</code></p>

<h3>Escaping Characters</h3>

<p>Some characters have meaning in Markdown, so when you want them to be displayed you may run into issues.  You can escape these characters, so that you can display them without side-effects.  To do so, put a backslash (<code>\</code>) before the character.</p>

<pre><code class="mxml">2 \+ 2
\#lol  
</code></pre>

<p>The following characters have this property:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;"> Symbol </th>
<th style="text-align:center;"> Name </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> # </td>

<td style="text-align:center;"> ` </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Backtick  </td>

<td style="text-align:center;"> * </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Asterisk  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> _ </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Underscore </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> {} </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Curly Braces </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> [] </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Square Brackets </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> () </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Parentheses </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> . </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Period </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> ! </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Excalamtion Point </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p><a id="links"></a></p>

<h2>Links</h2>

<p>For <a href="#links">links</a>, the text you want displayed is kept in brackets(<code>[]</code>), with the link kept in parentheses (<code>()</code>).  You can also include a title after the link, which generally appears as a tooltip.  These links will open in the current tab, so if you want the link to open in a new window or tab, use the html syntax.
<code>
[I will be shown](http://www.thisistheurl.com/ "A Link")
[Google](http://www.google.com)
</code>
You can also use a reference style for links.

</span><span class='line'>##Named Anchors
</span><span class='line'>If you want to create navigation from within the page, you can use named anchors, which is basically a link. At any headings that you want to be able to jump to, add `<span class="ni">&amp;lt;</span>a id=&quot;named-anchors&quot;<span class="ni">&amp;gt;&amp;lt;</span>/a<span class="ni">&amp;gt;</span>` so that the headings will look something like this:
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;headings&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<h2>Images</h2>

<p>Images are also similar to links.  They use the same syntax, but have an exclamation point (<code>!</code>) preceding them.  The text in the brackets will act as the alternative text, should the image not be able to load.  The text after the url is what will show up as a tooltip when the user hovers over the picture.</p>

<pre><code class="mxml ">![Pink](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4149/5018040485_28c0c3d9ef_b.jpg "Pink")

<p>You can also use a reference syntax.</p>

<pre><code class="mxml">![Pink Two][id]
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1268/4698397342_64065cf293_b.jpg" title="Pink Two" alt="Pink Two" /><cite><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/pulmonary_pathology/4698397342/in/photostream/" target="_blank">Hypersensitivity pneumonitis Case 127 - Yale Rosen</a></cite></p>

<p><a id="lists"></a></p>

<h2>Lists</h2>

<h3>Unordered Lists</h3>

<p>To create an unordered list use either an asterisk (<code>*</code>), a plus sign (<code>+</code>), or a hyphen (<code>-</code>) followed by a space before each bullet.</p>

<pre><code class="mxml">* This is a bullet
- This is also a bullet
  * This is a lower level 
    + Even lower 
      - And lower
        * So low 
          - Almost through the earth
+ And back up
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>This is a bullet</li>
<li>This is also a bullet

<ul>
<li>This is a lower level

<ul>
<li>Even lower

<ul>
<li>And lower

<ul>
<li>So low

<ul>
<li>Almost through the earth</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And back up</li>
</ul>


<h3>Ordered Lists</h3>

<p>Ordered lists are pretty self explanatory.  Simply precede each item in the list with the number or letter, followed by a period, followed by a space.</p>

<pre><code class="mxml ">1. This is the first item!
2. And this is the second 
3. I think you get it. . . 
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>This is the first item!</li>
<li>And this is the second</li>
<li>I think you get it. . .</li>
</ol>


<p>The numbering you put doesn't necessarily affect the numbering. For instance:
<code>mxml
1. I'm number 1
2. I'm number 2
A. I'm letter A
64. I'm number 64
</code>
Produces the following list:</p>

<ol>
<li>I'm number 1</li>
<li>I'm number 2</li>
<li>I'm letter A</li>
<li>I'm number 64</li>
</ol>


<p><a id="quotes"></a></p>

<h2>Quotes</h2>

<p>Quotes can be inserted by putting a greater than sign <code>&gt;</code> at the beginning of the line.  To site the sourse, use the <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> tags.</p>

<pre><code class="mxml ">&gt; My greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live.
&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Kanye West&lt;/cite&gt;
</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>My greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live.
<cite>Kanye West</cite></p></blockquote>

<p><a id="code-snippets"></a></p>

<h2>Code Snippets</h2>

<h3>Inline</h3>

<p>To create an inline code snippet (<code>like this!</code>), use the backtick (<code>`</code>) on either side of the item.</p>

<pre><code class="">`like this!`
</code></pre>

<h3>Indented</h3>

<p>You can create a code snippet through the use of indentation.  Add four spaces to the beginning of a line of code for this to work.</p>

<pre><code class="mxml ">        This is code.
        Am I right?
</code></pre>

<pre><code>This is code.
Am I right?
</code></pre>

<h3>Block</h3>

<p>To create block code, which is what I've been using for all of the code examples in this cheat sheet. To do this use three backticks on the top and bottom of the code snippet.  Next to the top three backticks, you can specify the language that you are writing the code in so that the syntax will be higlighted appropriately.  If you're not sure what code to use for a particular language, check out the short codes on this <a href="http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/#" target=_blank>reference guide</a>.<br/>
<code>rb
</code> rb
 def this_is_a_method(argument)
   result = argument * (1000)
 end
 <code>
</code></p>

<pre><code class="rb">def this_is_a_method(argument)
  result = argument * (1000)
end 
</code></pre>

<p><a id="tables"></a></p>

<h2>Tables</h2>

<p>Tables can be created through the use of pipes (<code>|</code>) to separate columns and dashes (<code>-</code>) to separate the titles from the rows.
<code>mxml
| Id | Name | Description |
| -- | ---- | ----------- |
| 1 | Elle Woods | Lawyer in pink |
| 2 | Emmett Forrest | Handsome husband |
| 3 | Bruiser Woods | Chic chihuahua|
</code></p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Id </th>
<th> Name </th>
<th> Description </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> 1 </td>
<td> Elle Woods </td>
<td> Lawyer in pink </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 2 </td>
<td> Emmett Forrest </td>
<td> Handsome husband </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 3 </td>
<td> Bruiser Woods </td>
<td> Chic chihuahua</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>By default, the table will be left aligned.  If you want to center the items in the table, use colons (<code>:</code>) as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="mxml">| Id | Name | Description | 
| :-:| :---:| :----------:| 
| 1 | Elle Woods | Lawyer in pink |
| 2 | Emmett Forrest | Handsome husband |
| 3 | Bruiser Woods | Chic chihuahua|
</code></pre>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;"> Id </th>
<th style="text-align:center;"> Name </th>
<th style="text-align:center;"> Description </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> 1 </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Elle Woods </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Lawyer in pink </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> 2 </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Emmett Forrest </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Handsome husband </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> 3 </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Bruiser Woods </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Chic chihuahua</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>You can also right align the information.
<code>mxml

| 3 | Bruiser Woods | Chic chihuahua|

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Generally, when someone thinks of a technical person, the only writing they associate with that person is code.  However, that is far from the truth.  Technical blogs are common, and for good reason.  So if you're trying to figure out if a technical blog is right for you, check out why you should start blogging:</p>

<h3>To Practice Writing</h3>

<p>Going to an engineering school, it's pretty normal to hear someone use their technical ability as an excuse for their poor writing skills. I tend to find this ironic, since many of these people have an "I'm an engineer, I can do anything!" mentality.  The problem with their writing is not a lack of ability, but instead a lack of practice.  Do yourself a favor and do not become one of these people.  Future employers will thank you, teammates will thank you, you will thank you, and of course, I will thank you. Keeping a technical blog, or any blog, will give you the opportunity to practice writing, which leads to the next reason to keep a blog.</p>

<h3>To Practice Expressing Yourself</h3>

<p>Writing gives you the opportunity to put your thoughts on paper (or text editor).  Practicing this skill will make it easier to articulate your ideas and express them clearly.  You will develop the ability to show someone what you're thinking, rather than stumbling over your words as you try to express your thoughts.  This is extremely beneficial when working on a team, or even working on a personal project.</p>

<h3>To Learn</h3>

<p>Writing about a technical topic requires knowledge and understanding of that topic.  I have found that there are times that I know that I can loosely explain a topic, but the knowledge that the explanation was going to be posted to the web pushes me to strengthen my understanding of the topic.</p>

<h3>For Reference</h3>

<p>Is there something that you're always looking up?  Make a tutorial! Chances are, you'll remember it after writing about it, and even if you don't you know exactly where to find it when you need to reference it.  Also, there's probably many other people that are always looking up the same thing.  Not only are you helping yourself, but helping to better the internet as a whole, and who doesn't want that?</p>

<h3>For Getting Noticed</h3>

<p>If you keep your blog up to date, professional, and tag it well, you're going to get some traffic.  This can lead to job offers, making connections, and some fame in your field.  If you get enough traffic, you can even get paid by adding advertisements.  While this shouldn't be your sole reason for starting a blog, it is a factor to acknowledge.</p>

<h3>It's Free</h3>

<p>Why should you keep a technical blog? Why not! It's free, so you can't use that excuse. Like I said earlier, you can help better the internet as a whole, and do so for free.  So do it! Just do it! <em>Cue Shia LaBeouf</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Installing a New Theme</h2>

<p>When Octopress is first installed, the theme is rather bland.  Luckily, it isn't difficult to change this.  There are a decent amount of Octopress themes available, allowing for customization of the overall feel of your blog.  To find an Octopress theme, check out imathis's <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes" target = _blank>compilation</a>.  Once you pick out a theme, follow the theme's documentation in order to install it.  For the majority of themes, installation will follow the following template:
<code>sh
cd octopress
git submodule add git://github.com/CREATORS-USERNAME/THEME-NAME.git .themes/THEME-NAME
rake install['THEME-NAME']
rake generate
</code>
The GitHub url is the HTTPS clone URL, which can be found on the right hand side of GitHub.</p>

<h2>Adding Custom CSS</h2>

<p>One of the best ways to set your blog apart is to add custom CSS.  Navigate to your <code>octopress</code> folder. Once there, <code>ls</code> should reveal a <code>sass</code> folder.  Navigate into that folder, and then into the <code>custom</code> folder.  Next, find <code>_styles.css</code>.  Open this file in your text editor.  This is where you can put your custom CSS.  A basic CSS tutorial can be found <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/" target = _blank>here</a>.  If you're having trouble figuring out how to style a particular element, many browsers implement Inspect Element, which is great for determining the html used for that particular element.</p>

<h2>Changing the Default Colors</h2>

<p>You can take your styling further by changing the default colors used by the theme.  This is done in a similar manner as adding custom CSS.  In the same folder where <code>_styles.css</code> was found (<code>/octopress/sass/custom/</code>), you will find <code>_colors.css</code>.  Open this file using your text editor.  The file should be documented, explaining where to change the colors.  Finding the perfect color is easy with <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colorpicker.asp" target = _blank>w3schools HTML Color Picker</a>.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Layouts</h2>

<p>Layouts are basically templates for your posts.  This makes it easy for you to have different designs, without having to manually set them up each time.  To add or modify layouts, navigate to your <code>octopress</code> folder.  Next, find and navigate to the <code>source</code> folder.  There you should find a <code>_layouts</code> folder with some predefined layouts.  You can modify any of the existing, or create your own by adding the html file to the <code>_layouts</code> folder.  Start off each layout with:</p>

<pre><code class="html">---
layout: LAYOUT_NAME
---
</code></pre>

<p>From there, add your custom code.  You can use the previously made layouts as a reference.</p>

<h2>Setting a Custom Favicon</h2>

<p>Changing the favicon is simple. Go back to the <code>source</code> folder (<code>/octopress/source/</code>).  There you will see <code>favicon.ico</code> or a similarly named .ico file.  Replace this file with your favicon, but make sure to keep the name of the file the same.  If you don't have a favicon yet, you can create one using a <a href="http://www.favicon.cc/" target=_blank>favicon generator</a>, make one from an image using a <a href="http://tools.dynamicdrive.com/favicon/" target=_blank>converter</a>, or find one using a <a href="http://www.freefavicon.com/freefavicons/objects/" target=_blank>favicon library</a>.</p>
