    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Space.  There's a reason that NASA and SpaceX are extremely selective with their employees.  This week I, along with three other Flatirons, have been working on a web application that would allow the user to see the stars that would be above them that night in their location.  So far it's a simple one page application that grabs the user's location when they go the site, crunches the numbers, and displays the result. Sounds simple right?  Wrong.</p>

<p>Well, not fully wrong.  But partially wrong. The code isn't that complicated.  Just a matter of passing around information from JavaScript to Rails and back again. That doesn't sound too hard, and it's really not.  But there's one problem. . . getting the information.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://s28.postimg.org/5odbge77x/VIIRS_4_Jan2012_708x432.jpg" width="370"> Well, not all the information is hard to collect.  Getting the user's location is simple.  Using that information is hard.  Think about it.  We have the earth, right.  And a person on that earth with a latitude and longitude.  And let's just say that person happens to be at <a href="http://flatironschool.com/" target="_blank">The Flatiron School</a>, which has a location of 40°42'19.3"N 74°00'50.2"W.  Suppose that very person decides to check out our website. As soon as they arrive their location information is collected using JavaScript.  An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)" target="_blank">AJAX</a> call later, that information is available in a controller.  Let's take a step back.  We have the user's coordinates.  As far as stars are concerned, what does that give us?  Everything. At least, everything that we need from the user.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Image_Tangent-plane.svg/2000px-Image_Tangent-plane.svg.png" width="200"> Our user wants to see the stars.  So let's listen to a popular piece of business advice and "give the user what they want".  How do we do that?  Well, we have their location. Let's think about how that relates to the stars in question.  The user can only see the stars that are above them at night.  For simplification purposes, let's say that the person can see the stars above the plane tangent to their location on the earth.  So how do we find what stars are above that plane given the person's latitude and longitude? <a href="http://www.mers.byu.edu/docs/reports/MERS9904.pdf" target="_blank">"Projecting an Arbitrary Latitude and Longitude onto a Tangent Plane"</a> by Ivan S. Ashcraft provides the mathematical formulas for finding the tangent plane given the information we have been provided with.  However, since we need to find the stars above, below, or on that plane, we only really need the normal (or perpendicular) vector to the plane.  Following Ashcraft's formulas we can get the i, j, and k components of that normal vector, which Ashcraft labels as A, B, and C.  Now that we have the normal vector, we need to adjust it to use the coordinate system that our stars use, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_coordinate_system" target="_blank">Galactic coordinate system</a>, which uses the sun as the center.  Because of the earth's orientation in comparison to the Galactic coordinate system, we need to rotate the normal by -240 degrees.  So we have the normal to the plane, but how do we figure out which stars are above that plane?</p>

<p>Finding out whether a star is above, below, or on the plane is simple, all we need to do is the dot product. For each star, we dot the coordinates with the i, j, and k components of the normal vector. This gives the following formula: <code>Ax + By + Cz</code>.  If the result of this formula is positive, we know that the star is above the plane and therefore visible at the location.  If the result is negative, the star is below the plane and not visible.  If the result is 0, the star is on the plane, which for this situation we'll consider not visible.  That wasn't too hard, now was it?</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the project wasn't too difficult.  However, conceptualizing what we needed to do to the data that we had to achieve our desired results was extremely difficult.  Especially with the added pressure of a week deadline.  However, by staying cool and taking things one step at a time, my group and I successfully finished <a href="http://lumensee.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">LUMENsee</a>. Check it out!</p>

    <id>http://tibsar.github.io/blog/low-self-esteem-try-coding</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Learning to code leads to much more than just a practical life skill. Throughout my journey at the <a href="http://flatironschool.com/" target="_blank">Flatiron School</a> I've noticed an unexpected benefit to learning how to code.  At week nine I feel confident and ready to take on the world. Now don't get me wrong, I still have a lot to learn, but I'm already finding that I'll be in the middle of doing something, find that I don't like how I have to do it, and create a way to fix it.  For instance, I wanted to tweet news articles, but didn't want to do it manually.  I created a program for it.  I don't like the way my school's enrollment website looks.  I'm making a Chrome extension to change that.  At week 9 in my programming career I can take a simple problem and fix it.  Furthermore, I've been given the tools I need to improve my skills and be able to create anything.  All it takes is a computer and some practice.  That is powerful.</p>

<p>One of the best parts of learning to code is that it can be as cheap as you want or need it to be.  While I chose to go down the bootcamp path, many have not.  With many online resources, learning the basics of coding can be completely free.  If you want to start, check out these free websites:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a></li>
<li><a href="http://codeschool.com/" target="_blank">Code School</a></li>
<li><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank">Treehouse</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Reading coding books is also a great way to learn to code.  I find that the best way to really understand what the code is doing is to read about it. There's plenty of free books available as well:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/" target="_blank">Learn to Program</a></li>
<li><a href="http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/" target="_blank">Learn Ruby the Hard Way</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/" target="_blank">Programming Ruby</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Ruby_Essentials" target="_blank">Ruby Essentials</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/" target="_blank">Bastards Book of Ruby</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/" target="_blank">Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I listed Ruby books since that's what I'm learning, but you can find an extensive list <a href="https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md#ruby" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>I also highly suggest getting involved in the social aspect of programming.  It keeps it interesting and gives you lots of opportunities to learn something new, or think about something from a new point of view.  Some great communities to check out are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackathonhackers/" target="_blank">Hackathon Hackers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/" target="_blank">r/programming</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dzone.com/" target="_blank">DZone</a></li>
</ul>


<p>At the end of the day, it all comes down to the effort you're willing to put in.  But remember, learning to program leads to a new way to express yourself, which brings along many unexpected benefits and an open door to opportunity.</p>

    <link href="http://tibsar.github.io/blog/how-to-turn-an-array-into-a-hash-using-ruby/"/>
    <updated>2015-07-17T15:35:49-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://tibsar.github.io/blog/how-to-turn-an-array-into-a-hash-using-ruby</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems like the hardest part of learning a language is knowing its tricks.  In Ruby, one of these tricks is turning an array into a hash.  So let's get started!</p>

<p>Suppose you have the following array:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby ">elegance_level = ["wedding", 10, "yacht", 10, "shack", 0, "wine", 8, "beer", 3, "cologne", 6]
</code></pre>

<p>This array seems to be assigning a level of elegance to the item before it, so a hash may be better suited for it.  You could iterate through the array and assign the values into a hash, however Ruby provides an easier way to accomplish this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby ">Hash[*elegance_level]
 =&gt; {"wedding"=&gt;10, "yacht"=&gt;10, "shack"=&gt;0, "wine"=&gt;8, "beer"=&gt;3, "cologne"=&gt;6} 
</code></pre>

<p>That's it! Hope you enjoyed this short but sweet refactor tip!</p>

    <link href="http://tibsar.github.io/blog/how-coding-bootcamps-are-like-greek-life/"/>
    <updated>2015-07-13T17:15:36-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://tibsar.github.io/blog/how-coding-bootcamps-are-like-greek-life</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Coding bootcamps are popping up <a href="http://www.skilledup.com/articles/the-ultimate-guide-to-coding-bootcamps-the-exhaustive-list" target=_blank>across the world</a>.  As a student at a NYC bootcamp, the <a href="http://flatironschool.com/" target=_blank>Flatiron School</a>, as well as a sorority sister of <a href="https://www.dphie.org/Home" target=_blank>Delta Phi Epsilon</a>, I couldn't help but notice some similarities between the two.</p>

<h3>New Member Class</h3>

<p>Even if you don't know much about Greek Life, "pledge classes" are notorious. Now commonly referred to as a "new member class", this is a group of people working towards full membership of the sorority or fraternity. New member classes are encouraged to do everything with each other while they bond over the shared difficulty of balancing the time commitment, classes, and other life responsibilities.  I finished pledging by the spring semester of my freshman year, however I find myself repeating the experience in many ways at the Flatiron School.  Instead of a pledge class of college girls, I'm working with a cohort of men and women in all walks of life.  We all are working towards the common goal of graduation from the program as well as jobs in software development.  During this experience, we all have to balance the intense workload as well as commutes and real world responsibilities. In many ways, my cohort is my pledge class.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://scontent-lga1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/1381481_732106783472536_1494142350_n.jpg?oh=130e32e1004e0c888cc99a607e733584&amp;oe=5625FD31" width="400" height="215"></p>

<h3>Mentorship</h3>

<p>One of the most exciting parts of pledging is getting a big.  This generally happens around halfway through the pledging process.  A big is expected to be a mentor to their little and support them through pledging and beyond. At the Flatiron School, we call this "mentorship".  In week 6, which is halfway through the bootcamp, we receive our mentors.  We can then contact our mentor via email and ask them questions about their experiences.  If they are local and available, we have the option of meeting with them in person as well. While this mentor is not as much of a physical presence as a big, their role is the same.  They share their experiences as someone that has previously experienced the long journey of becoming a developer and can be there to support their mentee through their journey.
<img class="center" src="https://scontent-lga1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/1425686_10151765451339499_2088666953_n.jpg?oh=5b79ce8958dca8bbaab83dfc796c4a35&amp;oe=56126F85" width="400" height="215"></p>

<h3>Getting Your Letters</h3>

<p>As a pledge class, we looked forward to the day that we would become full members and finally be able to wear letters.  It was a common part of conversation, as we would plan out what letters we would get and what fabric we would use to make them.  At the Flatiron School, my cohort is excited for the day we get our own Flatiron School hoodies (especially when the air conditioning is a tad too cold).  As a pledge, seeing the sisters wearing their letters was seen as something to work towards.  As a budding developer, seeing the TAs, faculty, and alumni wearing Flatiron gear is a push to keep working hard and a reminder that graduation isn't all that far off.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://themonogramexpress.com/images/thumbnails/rts233.jpg" width="400" height="215"></p>

<h3>Crossover</h3>

<p>As a new member, crossover is the ritual of rituals, the night that everyone has been waiting for, yet came as a surprise. When I was pledging, the date of crossover was kept a secret, so while we looked forward to it, we never knew quite when it would be.  However, when it came it was extremely exciting.  We were finally being accepted as full members of the organization that we had grown to adore.  At the Flatiron School, graduation holds a similar excitement.  While we know when we will be graduating, we can't help but get excited for crossing over from a Flatiron student to a Flatiron alumna.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Sorority life and bootcamp life aren't all that different.  Both involve a community of people looking out for each other. Both have new members that go through a journey towards a common goal.  Both encourage their members to be their best version of themselves. Personally, I think that's pretty neat.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Markdown Cheat Sheet]]></title>
    <link href="http://tibsar.github.io/blog/markdown-cheat-sheet/"/>
    <updated>2015-06-29T16:16:42-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://tibsar.github.io/blog/markdown-cheat-sheet</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Markdown is used <em>a lot</em>, so I figured a cheat sheet could be useful, so here goes:</p>

<h3><a href="#headings">Headings</a></h3>

<h3><a href="#paragraphs">Paragraphs</a></h3>

<h3><a href="#horizontal-rule">Horizontal Rule</a></h3>

<h3><a href="#text-styling">Text Styling</a></h3>

<h3><a href="#links">Links</a></h3>

<h3><a href="#named-anchors">Named Anchors</a></h3>

<h3><a href="#images">Images</a></h3>

<h3><a href="#lists">Lists</a></h3>

<h3><a href="#quotes">Quotes</a></h3>

<h3><a href="#tables">Tables</a></h3>

<p><a id="headings"></a></p>

<h2>Headings</h2>

<p>Headings in Markdown are preceded by the octothorpe (<code>#</code>).  You can also add trailing octothorpes, but this is optional.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">#This is heading 1!
##This is heading 2!##
###This is heading 3!
####This is heading 4!
#####This is heading 5!
######This is heading 6!######
</code></pre>

<p>Another way to create heading 1 and heading 2 are with equal signs (<code>=</code>) or dashes (<code>-</code>) under the text you want in the header.</p>

<pre><code class="mxml ">I'm header 1
============

I'm header 2 
------------
</code></pre>

<p><a id="paragraphs"></a></p>

<h2>Paragraphs</h2>

<p>Paragraphs are determined based off a new line or at least two spaces at the end of a line.</p>

<pre><code class="mxml ">This is the first paragraph, since there is no line separating it from the next sentences.  I'm still in paragraph one.
I'm also in paragraph 1, since there's no blank line. 

I'm in paragraph 2!
</code></pre>

<p><a id="horizontal-rule"> </a></p>

<h2>Horizontal Rule</h2>

<p>You can break up paragraphs with a horizontal line.</p>

<hr />

<p>Just do any of the following:</p>

<p><code>___</code> Three underscores</p>

<p><code>---</code> Three dashes</p>

<p><code>***</code> Three asterisks</p>

<p><a id="text-styling"></a></p>

<h2>Text Styling</h2>

<p>For text styling, the asterisk (<code>*</code>) or underscore(<code>_</code>) is used.</p>

<h3>Bold</h3>

<p>To make an item <strong>bold</strong>, use two asterisks on each side of the item.
<code>mxml
**I'm bold. :D**
__So am I!__
I'm not. :(
</code></p>

<h3>Italic</h3>

<p>To make an item <em>italic</em>, use one asterisk on either side of the item.
<code>mxml
*I'm italic. :D*
_So am I!_
I'm not. :(
</code></p>

<h3>Strikethrough</h3>

<p>To <del>strikethrough</del> an item, use two tildes (<code>~</code>) on either side of the item.
<code>mxml
~~I've been struck!~~
I have not.
</code></p>

<h3>Escaping Characters</h3>

<p>Some characters have meaning in Markdown, so when you want them to be displayed you may run into issues.  You can escape these characters, so that you can display them without side-effects.  To do so, put a backslash (<code>\</code>) before the character.</p>

<pre><code class="mxml">2 \+ 2
\#lol  
</code></pre>

<p>The following characters have this property:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;"> Symbol </th>
<th style="text-align:center;"> Name </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> # </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Octothorpe </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> + </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Plus Sign </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> - </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Hyphen </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> \ </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Backslash </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> ` </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Backtick  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> * </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Asterisk  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> _ </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Underscore </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> {} </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Curly Braces </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> [] </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Square Brackets </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> () </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Parentheses </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> . </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Period </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> ! </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Excalamtion Point </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p><a id="links"></a></p>

<h2>Links</h2>

<p>For <a href="#links">links</a>, the text you want displayed is kept in brackets(<code>[]</code>), with the link kept in parentheses (<code>()</code>).  You can also include a title after the link, which generally appears as a tooltip.  These links will open in the current tab, so if you want the link to open in a new window or tab, use the html syntax.
<code>
[I will be shown](http://www.thisistheurl.com/ "A Link")
[Google](http://www.google.com)
</code>
You can also use a reference style for links.

</span><span class='line'>If you want to create navigation from within the page, you can use named anchors, which is basically a link.

<h2>Images</h2>

<p>Images are also similar to links.  They use the same syntax, but have an exclamation point (<code>!</code>) preceding them.  The text in the brackets will act as the alternative text, should the image not be able to load.  The text after the url is what will show up as a tooltip when the user hovers over the picture.</p>

<pre><code class="mxml ">![Pink](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4149/5018040485_28c0c3d9ef_b.jpg "Pink")
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4149/5018040485_28c0c3d9ef_b.jpg" title="Pink" alt="Pink" /><cite><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/30950973@N03/5018040485" target="_blank">Small cell carcinoma - Yale Rosen</a></cite></p>

<p>You can also use a reference syntax.</p>

<pre><code class="mxml">![Pink Two][id]
</code></pre>

<h2>Lists</h2>

<h3>Unordered Lists</h3>

<p>To create an unordered list use either an asterisk (<code>*</code>), a plus sign (<code>+</code>), or a hyphen (<code>-</code>) followed by a space before each bullet.</p>

<pre><code class="mxml">* This is a bullet
- This is also a bullet
  * This is a lower level 
    + Even lower 
      - And lower
        * So low 
          - Almost through the earth
+ And back up
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>This is a bullet</li>
<li>This is also a bullet

<ul>
<li>This is a lower level

<ul>
<li>Even lower

<ul>
<li>And lower

<ul>
<li>So low

<ul>
<li>Almost through the earth</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And back up</li>
</ul>


<h3>Ordered Lists</h3>

<p>Ordered lists are pretty self explanatory.  Simply precede each item in the list with the number or letter, followed by a period, followed by a space.</p>

<pre><code class="mxml ">1. This is the first item!
2. And this is the second 
3. I think you get it. . . 
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>This is the first item!</li>
<li>And this is the second</li>
<li>I think you get it. . .</li>
</ol>


<p>The numbering you put doesn't necessarily affect the numbering. For instance:
<code>mxml
1. I'm number 1
2. I'm number 2
A. I'm letter A
64. I'm number 64
</code>
Produces the following list:</p>

<ol>
<li>I'm number 1</li>
<li>I'm number 2</li>
<li>I'm letter A</li>
<li>I'm number 64</li>
</ol>

<h2>Quotes</h2>

<p>Quotes can be inserted by putting a greater than sign <code>&gt;</code> at the beginning of the line.  To site the sourse, use the <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> tags.</p>

<pre><code class="mxml ">&gt; My greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live.
&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Kanye West&lt;/cite&gt;
</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>My greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live.

<p><a id="code-snippets"></a></p>

<h2>Code Snippets</h2>

<h3>Inline</h3>

<p>To create an inline code snippet (<code>like this!</code>), use the backtick (<code>`</code>) on either side of the item.</p>

<pre><code class="">`like this!`
</code></pre>

<h3>Indented</h3>

<p>You can create a code snippet through the use of indentation.  Add four spaces to the beginning of a line of code for this to work.</p>

<pre><code class="mxml ">        This is code.
        Am I right?
</code></pre>

<pre><code>This is code.
Am I right?
</code></pre>

<h3>Block</h3>

<p>To create block code, which is what I've been using for all of the code examples in this cheat sheet. To do this use three backticks on the top and bottom of the code snippet.  Next to the top three backticks, you can specify the language that you are writing the code in so that the syntax will be higlighted appropriately.  If you're not sure what code to use for a particular language, check out the short codes on this <a href="http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/#" target=_blank>reference guide</a>.<br/>
<code>rb
</code> rb
 def this_is_a_method(argument)
   result = argument * (1000)
 end
 <code>
</code></p>

<pre><code class="rb">def this_is_a_method(argument)
  result = argument * (1000)
end 
</code></pre>

<p><a id="tables"></a></p>

<h2>Tables</h2>

<p>Tables can be created through the use of pipes (<code>|</code>) to separate columns and dashes (<code>-</code>) to separate the titles from the rows.
<code>mxml
| Id | Name | Description |
| -- | ---- | ----------- |
| 1 | Elle Woods | Lawyer in pink |
| 2 | Emmett Forrest | Handsome husband |
| 3 | Bruiser Woods | Chic chihuahua|
</code></p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Id </th>
<th> Name </th>
<th> Description </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> 1 </td>
<td> Elle Woods </td>
<td> Lawyer in pink </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 2 </td>
<td> Emmett Forrest </td>
<td> Handsome husband </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 3 </td>
<td> Bruiser Woods </td>
<td> Chic chihuahua</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>By default, the table will be left aligned.  If you want to center the items in the table, use colons (<code>:</code>) as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="mxml">| Id | Name | Description | 
| :-:| :---:| :----------:| 
| 1 | Elle Woods | Lawyer in pink |
| 2 | Emmett Forrest | Handsome husband |
| 3 | Bruiser Woods | Chic chihuahua|
</code></pre>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;"> Id </th>
<th style="text-align:center;"> Name </th>
<th style="text-align:center;"> Description </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> 1 </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Elle Woods </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Lawyer in pink </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> 2 </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Emmett Forrest </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Handsome husband </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> 3 </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Bruiser Woods </td>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Chic chihuahua</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>You can also right align the information.
<code>mxml
| Id | Name | Description |
| --:| ----:| ----------: |
| 1 | Elle Woods | Lawyer in pink |
| 2 | Emmett Forrest | Handsome husband |
| 3 | Bruiser Woods | Chic chihuahua|
</code></p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:right;"> Id </th>
<th style="text-align:right;"> Name </th>
<th style="text-align:right;"> Description </th>

<td style="text-align:right;"> 1 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> Elle Woods </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> Lawyer in pink </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 2 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> Emmett Forrest </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> Handsome husband </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 3 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> Bruiser Woods </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> Chic chihuahua</td>
</tr>
